                <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio, which I made to demonstate what can do about coding some example website. My name is Przemek Woźnica and I am from Poland.
                    Living in Łódź actually. I am 29 years old. I am passionate about pogramming websites and apps.
                    Learning for 5 years about different languages and techniques but I have not studied at university,  
                    instead learning on my own from books, courses and from my own mistakes. I search for chance to start work in IT.
                    Currently working as guardian in one of town hall buildings so I have got much time to learn ;)
                    Trained in HTML, CSS and JAVASSCRIPT for front end purposes and JAVA to set back end.
                    Really like using REACT library and SPRING FRAMWEWORK. My weak points are app testing I have basically never tried writing tests
                    and I do not know how to efficiently work on project with other people, but atleast I can learn fast.
                </p>
                <span className="greeting">Good day and hope you will like my website</span>
            </div>
        </section>
    )
}

export default data
